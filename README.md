Process Flow Micro Service
Concept Summary
 
Over a period collection of loosely-coupled services evolve in the name of microservice which is a variant of the service-oriented architecture, in a medium to large
organisation, hundreds and thousands of microservices get but and bring the next level of challenge to building the same microservices again and again or fails to reuse 
the existing services optimally. Thus wasting time, cost and agility to bring customer needs quickly to the market. Process flow microservices aim to solve this problem 
by giving the right exposure to the available services, using them and through a process flow framework reuse the already build services.
 
Problem Context
 
Reusability can be increased using a process flow approach of choosing the microservices 
Maintainability is much easier to pick and choose the services of the right feature and decision making of what information can be re-used and what is the domain or
business-specific details.
